Japanese chess-type board game implemented using JavaFX

This was supposed to be a small Hackathon project, but it turned out to be a much larger application used as a semestral project into a course
Programming languages 1.

This was a 2-man job to practice some teamwork, I did most the logical part, figures and board. My friend implemented the graphic controller
idea and designed database-based networking.

We didn't know how to correctly use source control that time, so there are no branches or commits provided in this repository.
