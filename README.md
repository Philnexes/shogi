Japanese chess-type board game implemented using JavaFX

This was supposed to be a small Hackathon project, but it turned out to be a much larger application used as a semestral project into a course
Programming languages 1.

This was a 2-man job to practice some teamwork, I did most the logical part, figures and board. My friend implemented the graphic controller
idea and designed database-based networking.

We didn't know how to correctly use source control that time, so there are no branches or commits provided in this repository.
Most of the code was done in a very short period of time during our learning of JavaFX, so the code might not be as clean as professionals would expect. Nonetheless, I decided to publish this job as a part of my portfolio anyway.
